# Beolyd5

Back in the day, I absolutely adored the [BeoSound 5](https://beo.zone/en/beosound-5), which I thought was a very beautifully designed item for the home - alongside being a sound system.

Unfortunately, Bang & Olufsen made a number of unfortunate choices, not preparing the product for future software updates. This has left the Windows XP-based system in the past, unable to provide modern streaming services or the like.

This project aims to bring new life into this device, with modern hardware and an open source platform to drive it.

And the project name? Well, "sound" is "lyd" in danish ;-)

## The crate

This crate enables an easy interface for the BeoSound 5 controller.

The project is intended for RaspberryPI, but should work on any Linux, Windows, or MacOS-based system with a USB port.


## Support

This is a hobby project of mine.  I don't know when I will be done or how it will look.

I am not a UI designer, so I could use some help in that department. Likewise, I am still a beginner in the embedded world, so defintately would appreciate a helping hand there as well.

Just start a discussion or create an issue then I'll get back to you.
